After cleaning and analysing the data, I concluded that the data does not shows a significant difference between SP98 and E10 when talking about consumtion. I would need further analysis to get more insigths, or focusing better on an idea instead of trying to check all at the same time.


I would have wanted to check more hypothesis regarding the relation between consumtion and temperature outside having in mind the different gas type, but I haven't got the time.
