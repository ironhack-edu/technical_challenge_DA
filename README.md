Cobify is a company dedicated to people transport just like Uber, Lyft or even Cabify (who clearly stole our name).

Cobify was founded in 1992 coinciding with the Olympic Games hosted in Barcelona. Our company has always been known by:

- Not having permits to drive people (we do know how to drive)
- Using tricked-out high-end car

In our home town, Barcelona, VTC licenses have appeared and we have been able to start being a legal company, because we do have licenses now. However, we still keep using tricked-out high-end cars.

We are an old school company and data analysis falls far beyond our reach, and as we do not want to be on the news we want to know how you can help our business.

#### A bit of history of the gas problem ‚õΩÔ∏è

Tricked-out cars use gas with a high cetane index, like unleaded 98 petrol in order to avoid delay/advancing in combustible injection (avoiding connecting rod pitting ), but we have started to embrace petrols that add ethanol in their formula, as they are cheaper and they use the same cetane index as more expensive petrol. Without going into further detail (we could write an actual book about this) we think that going green and being modern can be very expensive, as we have seen that cars use more petrol than they used to for each trip.

#### Your challenge starts here üìà

Now it is your turn: can you help us find the best combustible?
We have saved some consumption data in a .csv, but‚Ä¶ it would be very nice if you could add some more data. You can find data in the repo :-)

Show us your abilities and make yourself worth the amount of money you'd like to get paid. You have **3 hours** to turn the challenge in starting right now! üí∏
