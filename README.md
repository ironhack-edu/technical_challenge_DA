# Car fuel consumption challenge

Cobify is a company dedicated to people transport just like Uber, Lyft or even Cabify (who clearly stole our name).

Cobify was founded in 1992 coinciding with the Olympic Games hosted in Barcelona. The company has always been known by:

- Not having permits to drive people (we do know how to drive)
- Using tricked-out high-end car

#### The gas problem ‚õΩÔ∏è

Tricked-out cars use gas with a high cetane index, like unleaded 98 petrol in order to avoid delay/advancing in combustible injection (avoiding connecting rod pitting ), but now car petrols are embraced that add ethanol in their formula, as they are cheaper and they use the same cetane index as more expensive petrol. 

#### The target üìà

Which gas type is more efficient?

#### Progress 

- In this project the data were cleaned, analyzed and visualized. New data were insert in order to have a full perspective of the issue. 
- Trying to do modeling but the hypothesis test was the key to the answer.
